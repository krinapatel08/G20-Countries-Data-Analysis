# 🌍 G20 Countries Economic & Social Insights Using World Bank API

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores key economic and social indicators across G20 countries by collecting data directly from the **World Bank API**.

Using Python, I automated the retrieval and analysis of data related to **GDP**, **life expectancy**, **CO₂ emissions**, **education**, **sanitation**, and more. The goal is to uncover global development trends and visualize insights using Python libraries.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- wbdata (World Bank API)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📌 Key Features

- Live data collection via World Bank API  
- Data cleaning and transformation with Pandas# 🌍 G20 Countries Economic & Social Insights Using World Bank API

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores key **economic and social indicators** across G20 countries by collecting live data from the **World Bank API**.

Using Python, I automated the retrieval and analysis of indicators such as **GDP per capita**, **life expectancy**, **CO₂ emissions**, **education levels**, and **sanitation access**. The goal is to uncover development trends and generate actionable insights through data visualization and analysis.
