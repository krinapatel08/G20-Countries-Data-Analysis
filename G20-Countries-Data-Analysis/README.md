# 🌍 G20 Countries Economic & Social Insights Using World Bank API

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes key **economic and social indicators** across G20 countries using real-time data collected from the **World Bank API**.

Using Python, I automated the extraction, cleaning, and analysis of indicators such as **GDP per capita**, **life expectancy**, **CO₂ emissions**, **education levels**, and **sanitation access**. The goal is to uncover development patterns, identify regional disparities, and generate insights that support data-driven decision-making.
